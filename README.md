# City Python Game

You just have to download the compressed folder in .rar and find three documents in it:

1. city_data which is a SQLite database in which the placed trees and lights are stored.

2. Allowed distances, which is a notebook with JSON tags that will determine the space required to place one object relative to another.

3. Optimized territorial planning, which is a single python file that will make the video game work.
